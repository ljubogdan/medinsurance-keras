# Medical Insurance Premium Prediction

This project predicts medical insurance costs using machine learning models based on individual features such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and geo-location.

## Description

The main objective is to build and evaluate regression models to accurately estimate insurance premiums. The workflow includes data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and training of both Linear Regression and Artificial Neural Network models.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)  
- Scikit-learn (for Linear Regression and data processing)  
- TensorFlow & Keras (for building and training neural networks)  

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations  
- Regression modeling using Linear Regression and Neural Networks  
- Model evaluation and comparison  

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- Required Python libraries (listed above)  

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Run the Python scripts to reproduce the analysis and modeling steps
